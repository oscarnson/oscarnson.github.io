        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Matthew McConaughey</h4>

        <h5 style="text-align: center;">Thank you all of these performances were impeccable. 
        In my opinion I didn't see a false note anywhere. 
        I want to thank Jean-Marc Vallee our director. 
        I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner who I worked with daily. 
        There are three things that I need each day. One, I need something to look up to, another to look forward to, 
        and another is someone to chase. First off, I want to thank God because that's who I look up. 
        He's graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or of any other hand. 
        He's shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. 
        To my family is to what I look forward to. To my father who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo, 
        he has a big lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and has a big can of Miller Lite and 
        he's dancing right now. To you dad, you taught me how to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and 
        my two older brothers -- demanded -- that we respect ourselves. 
        And in turn we learned we were better able to learn how to respect others. Thank you for that mama. 
        To my wife, Camilla, and my kids Levi, Vida and Mr Stone (Livingstone), the courage you give me every time I walk through the door is unparallelled. 
        You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you. And to my hero. That's who I chase. 
        When I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come and ask me 'Who's your hero?' 
        I said, 'I thought about it and it's me in ten years. So I turned 25 ten years later and that same person comes to me and goes, 
        'Are you a hero?' I said, 'Not even close!' She said why and I said, 'My hero is me at 35.' You see, every day, and every week, 
        and every month, and every year of my life, my hero is always ten years away. I'm never going to be my hero. 
        I'm not going to obtain that and that's fine with me because it keeps me with somebody to keep on chasing. 
        So to any of us, whatever those things are and whatever it is we look up to, 
        whatever it is we look forward to and whoever it is we're chasing, to that I say Amen. 
        To that I say alright, alright, alright. And just keep living, huh? Thank you.</h5>
    

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Rami Malek  </h4>
<p>
<h5 style="text-align:center">This is truly extraordinary. Really, thank you to BAFTA for this gorgeous gift. 
I still cannot believe that I'm included with this group of actors; actors I so respect and admire. 
I share this with you guys, every moment. I thank my lucky stars. It's quite difficult entering your world in this role as an outsider. 
You Brits, do you it so well, and it's not lost on me how sacred your musical heritage is. So thank you, thank you, 
thank you for including me. I have to thank Fox and New Regency and our producers, Graham King and Denis O'Sullivan, 
and Dexter Fletcher and this extraordinary cast and crew that I had the blessing -- so blessed to work with every day. 
I thank you. I would not be here without each and every one of you. Thank you so very much to Queen, to Brian May and to Roger Taylor, 
to the entire Queen family. I wouldn't be here without you. And to the greatest outsider of them all, for being so unwavering 
and unflinching and uncompromising in every which way, thank you, Freddie Mercury, again.</h5>

    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Leonardo DiCaprio </h4>
    <p>
    <h5 style="text-align:center">
 Thank you, thank you all so very much. Thank you to the Academy, thank you to all of you in this room. 
 I have to congratulate the other incredible nominees this year for their unbelievable performances. 
 The Revenant was a product of the tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast and crew I got to work alongside. 
 First off to my brother in this endeavor, Mr. Tom Hardy. Tom, your fierce talent on screen can only be surpassed by your friendship 
 off screen. To Mr. Alejandro Iñárritu, as the history of cinema unfolds, you have forged your way into history these past two years. 
 What an unbelievable talent you are, thank you to you and Chivo for creating a transcendent cinematic experience for all of us. 
 Thank you to everyone from Fox and New Regency, in particular Arnon Milchan, you are the champion of this endeavor. My entire team. 
 I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career, Mr. Caton Jones for casting me in my first film. 
 Mr. Scorsese for teaching me so much about the cinematic art form. To Mr. Rick Yorn, 
 thank you for helping me navigate my way through this industry. 
 And to my parents none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends I love you dearly you know who you are. 
 And lastly I just want to say this. Making The Revenant was about man's relationship to the natural world. 
 A world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. 
 Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. 
 Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species 
 and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world 
 who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity for the indigenous people of the world. 
 For the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this. For our children's' children. 
 And for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed. I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. 
 Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much. </h5>
